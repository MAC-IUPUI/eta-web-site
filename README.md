# Project Eta

Project Eta is a web server written in Typescript, taking advantage of
[MVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller) patterns
to improve readability, maintainability, and everything-else-ability when building
web applications. Project Eta has evolved significantly from its previous iterations,
built at both @MAC-IUPUI and @crossroads-education.
