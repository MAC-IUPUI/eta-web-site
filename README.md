Build status: [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/crossroads-education/eta/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/crossroads-education/eta/tree/master)

Project Eta is a web server written in Typescript, taking advantage of
[MVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller) patterns
to improve readability, maintainability, and everything-else-ability when building
web applications. Project Eta has evolved significantly from its previous iterations,
built at both [@MAC-IUPUI](https://github.com/MAC-IUPUI) (https://mac.iupui.edu) and
[@crossroads-education](https://github.com/crossroads-education) (https://crossroadseducation.org).

## Setup

Please see [SETUP.md](https://github.com/crossroads-education/eta/blob/master/docs/SETUP.md)
